# message-decoder
Reads a file and analyzes how many times each character is used

This program utilizes techniques of reading files, converting strings to char arrays, and passing pointers to arrays through methods. After reading the file (in the "HOME" directory, on my linux system), it displays the message, then counts the occurrences of each alphabetcal character. Every alphabetical character that is used is displayed along with it's uses and percentage of the total message. This is a basic technque for cryptogarphy, the most often used characters are likely vowels.
